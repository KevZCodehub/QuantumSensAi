Overview
This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict tremors in the Earth's crust. The goal is to leverage data from industry experts to forecast seismic activities and provide early warnings, potentially minimizing damage and loss of life.

Developed during a hackathon, this project showcases the power of predictive modeling in the field of geosciences, using expert data to make real-time earthquake predictions.

Features
Data-Driven Predictions: Utilizes geophysical data such as seismic readings, fault line activity, and geological measurements from industry experts.
Machine Learning Model: Implements advanced machine learning algorithms to predict tremors with high accuracy.
Real-Time Analysis: Capable of performing real-time data analysis and prediction based on new incoming data.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, making it accessible to both geoscientists and the general public.
Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset provided by industry experts, including:

Seismic activity logs
Historical earthquake data
Fault line data
Geological survey information
Model Architecture
The project employs a supervised learning model, specifically:

Model: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or other ensemble models (depending on final implementation).
Training Process: The model was trained on historical earthquake data to learn patterns leading up to tremors.
Evaluation: The model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
